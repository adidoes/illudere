Illudere watchface
==================

This is a custom watchface for the Pebble smart watch. [Download it][0].

It looks like this:

Although it may not be immediately apparent, there are 4 large digits on this
face. The background consists of lines going one direction. The foreground, or
the digits, has lines in the other direction. The edges of digits appear as
corners in these lines, so where ever you see a corner, try to follow it to see
the rest of the edge of a digit. Once you can see one, it shouldn't be hard to
find the rest.

Thanks to [RichardG][2] for the assets. Based on the [Kisai Optical Illusion 
watch from TokyoFlash][1].
